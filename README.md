This repo is for a university project for OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I figured out many people can still learn lots from it, so I'll leave it open here.

The project is written in C++ and uses [RayGUI](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) as the graphical interface (so technically it's cross platform, but I never tried compiling it on platforms other than Linux). The app allows PC shop owners to manage their components such as CPUs, storage drives, cameras and so on, as well as build "stations" using the various components available, and automatically calculate the total price of the station and update stock for each component.

The interface is not in English, but I don't think I'll bother translating it since I'm basically done with that project.

There are a good number of interesting concepts applied, like various OOP principles, makefile, GUI and so on, so if you want to learn from a complete project, you can do that. Also because of how messy the code is, I would not recommend using it in a production environment (at least not without lots of refactoring).
